                          <p>Surrounded by many legends and stories, Burabay has at least 14 lakes, surrounded by mountains and evergreen forest. The best view of the lakes is open from the top of Mount Bolektau, which is very easy to climb. In addition to trekking, climbing, swimming in lakes, boating, and other outdoor activities, you can visit a tourist center with a yurt village to learn more about the culture of nomads, or the Botai-Burabay Museum, which demonstrates dwellings of the tribes, who first domesticated horses about 6000 years ago.</p>

                          <p>Birdwatching tours are very popular in the reserve due to the fact that the northernmost flamingo population nests here. The best time to observe the birds is in the spring – the nesting season – and in the autumn when they gather in large flocks to migrate to warmer climes. In summer, flamingos are scattered across the lakes and you can see them, but in smaller numbers.</p>
