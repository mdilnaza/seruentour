    <h1>About Nur-Sultan</h1>
    <p> Nur-Sultan is the capital of Kazakhstan and its cultural center. This city surprises the visitors with its cosmic views.<br> It is worth visiting for everyone who loves modern architecture and wants to understand the spirit of Kazakhstan.</p>
    <p> Since it was declared the future capital of Kazakhstan and replaced Almaty by
    President Nazarbayev in 1997, <br>
    this small provincial city, known for its "cold" winters, has "experienced" explosive growth and has
    become the second largest in the country.<br>
    Nur-Sultan is located in the north-east of the country on the banks of the Ishim River. </p>
    <p> The city was designed by renowned architects using the most innovative civil engineering techniques. <br>
    The left bank of Nur-Sultan is built up from scratch with magnificent buildings, and the cozy atmosphere of the past reigns on the right bank.
