This is a square building with four 63-meter-high minarets in its corners. The magnificent dome, 40 meters high, is decorated with gilding. Inside the mosque, there is a spacious hall, which can hold 3,000 visitors. The women's hall, which accommodates about 500 people, is located on the second floor above the main hall.
